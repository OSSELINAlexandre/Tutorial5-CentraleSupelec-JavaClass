# Solution to the tutorial 5 of Java Class CentraleSupelec

Tutorial 5 required to implement a Java program that allows the user to operate on
maps of metro network of a given city, typically the user should be capable of searching which metro stations are in the network and searching for a path in the network
connecting a source station to a destination station. For this you have to design
an abstract data type (ADT) for representing graph-like structures which you will
use for storing a dedicated representation of a metro network.

I designed the ADT for representing the graph structure, the algorithm that find a path and the interface with Java EE.

However, the database was already given. I other words, for this algorithm to works on other databases, these db have to follow a given structure.
